{{/*
    This template replaces the .Content variable native to Hugo. I do this to
    allow shifting of headers from the markdown, so that the generated HTML is
    valid, without making it annoying to write the Markdown.

    In the Markdown, the topmost header can still be indicated with `#`, whereas
    in the rendered HTML, it will likely be h2 or h3, depending on context.
